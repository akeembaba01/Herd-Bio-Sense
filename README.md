Cattle Health Compass
The Cattle Health Compass is a simple, visual tool designed to help farmers assess and monitor the heat stress tolerance of their cattle. By integrating advanced statistical analysis (Principal Component Analysis or PCA) into an easy-to-use interface, it translates complex biochemical data into a practical "health map" of your herd.

Key Features:
Intuitive Health Assessment: Farmers can input their observations on a cow's health, hormonal balance, and heat stress level using a simple 1-3 scale.
Visual Health Map: The tool instantly plots the cow's health profile on a two-dimensional map, showing its position relative to three distinct cattle breeds (Brangus, Kedah-Kelantan, and Holstein Friesian).
Persistent Data Storage: You can save and track individual cow profiles over time, allowing for long-term health monitoring and early detection of potential issues.
Actionable Insights: The visualization helps identify at-risk animals and provides a clear picture of how different health factors contribute to a cow's overall well-being.
This tool makes advanced data analysis accessible and actionable, empowering farmers to make more informed decisions for a healthier and more productive herd.
